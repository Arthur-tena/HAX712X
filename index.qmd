# HAX712X: Software development for data science

(Almost) everything you need to know as an applied mathematician/statistician concerning coding and system administration.

## Teachers

- Joseph Salmon: joseph.salmon@umontpellier.fr,
- Benjamin Charlier: benjamin.charlier@umontpellier.fr

This course material was improved with the help of some students including:

- Amelie Vernay
- Tanguy Lefort


## Prerequisite

Students are expected to know basic notions of probabilities, optimization, linear algebra and statistics for this course.
Some rudiments in coding are also expected (if, for, while, functions) but not mandatory.

## Course description

This course focuses on discovering good coding practices (the language used is Python, but some elements of bash and git will also be useful) for professional coding.
A special focus on data processing and visualization will be at the heart of the course.
We will mostly focus on basic programming concepts, as well as on discovering the Python scientific libraries, including ```numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn```.
Beyond `pandas` ninja skills, we will also introduce modern practices for coders: (unitary) tests, version control, documentation generation, etc.

## Grading

### Intermediate projects (20 % + 10 %)

Two projects will be required, a group project and a personal one.

1. This is a personal project. We expect you to create a simple GitHub page, with information answering the guidelines. This part corresponds to **20% of the final grade**. The due date is **November 16 (23:59)**.

2. This part consists in starting the group project. It will consist of preliminary work and organization of the workload, git first steps for the group project. The groups will be available on [Moodle](https://moodle.umontpellier.fr/course/view.php?id=22454r). This part corresponds to **10% of the final grade**. The due date is **October 16 (23:59)**

### Final project (70 %)

The details of the projects might evolve before the allocation phase, and a precise grid will be given in the project section.

The project repository **must show a balanced contribution between group members** and intra-group grade variation could be made to reflect issues on the intra-group workload balance.
The due date will be around mid-December (**TBD**).

### Bonus

**1 supplementary point** on the final grade of the course can be obtained for contributions to improve the course material (practicals, Readme, etc.).
See the [Bonus](Bonus/) section for more details on how to proceed.



## Books and other resources

The resources for the course are available on the present `GitHub` repository. Additional elementary elements (**in French**) on Python are available in the course [HLMA310](http://josephsalmon.eu/HLMA310.html) and the associated lecture notes [IntroPython.pdf](http://josephsalmon.eu/enseignement/Montpellier/HLMA310/IntroPython.pdf).
